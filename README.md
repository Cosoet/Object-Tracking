# a playground code for real-time object tracking 

![image](https://github.com/Cosoet/Object-Tracking/blob/master/demo/demo.gif)


Implemented detector for tracking the selected object in a video  
Utilizing a pre-trained SiamMask model to mask the object

Added features:
function to draw an object's moving path
an error handling for the detector to deal with the problem of missing the object in the frame  


Before using:

please download the pre-trained model from [pre-trained model](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md)
